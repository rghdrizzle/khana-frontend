### KHANA-a simple restaurant application
KHANA is a Restaurant reservation application which was made using React JS, a JavaScript library to make awesome UI ,HTML, Flask and Firebase.

This application uses React JS component oriented UI creation paradigm. All components are written in JSX and ES6 style and are combined to get a single build for production purpose using Webpack 5.

ES6 module creation along with import /export is used. Babel is used to transpile all JSX code to vanilla JavaScript code. To install all the dependecies npm is used.

Back end is implemented using Flask (which runs on python) and Firebase

About Flask:
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python.Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself.Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools.


Firebase is an MBaaS (mobile backend as a service) from Google that provides all the features that most apps would need from an MBaaS, with support for both web and mobile clients

Finally, we deploy the website using Heroku which is a cloud service platform.
